# From the plot, it is clear there are segments that do not belong.
# By accessing the ``Segmenter`` attributes, the algorithm and this error are better understood (and resolved).

# [1.602000e+03, 1.782000e+03, 6.541974e-01]])

# As shown in the output, there are a total of 6 segments found before clustering.

# As the distribution of segments is apporx. [0.99,0.99,0.89,0.88,0.72,0.65],
# the attribute, ``Segmenter.cAdd``, (defaults to 0.5) that is added for forcing clusters
# only combines the last two values, 0.72 and 0.65 in the lower cluser.

# Modifying this attribute would then change the clusters, for example:

s.cAdd = 0.8
np.around(s.segment(), decimals=7)
# array([[1.200000e+03, 1.420000e+03, 9.916268e-01],
# [2.000000e+02, 4.000000e+02, 9.904041e-01]])


# If the attribute is removed, then only the original segments are used in the clustering.
# However, this results in the same cluster as the original where the default of ``cAdd`` was 0.5.

s.cAdd = None
np.around(s.segment(), decimals=7)
# array([[1.200000e+03, 1.420000e+03, 9.916268e-01],

# [4.000000e+02, 5.820000e+02, 8.933443e-01],
# [1.421000e+03, 1.601000e+03, 8.833249e-01]])

# Alternatively, the minimum correlation for a given segment can be set with the ``Segmenter.cMin`` attribute.

s.cMin = 0.9
np.around(s.segment(),decimals=7)
# array([[1.200000e+03, 1.420000e+03, 9.916268e-01]])


# Since the ``cAdd`` was removed, the only segments available (higher than 0.9 correlation)
# were both 0.99, making the clustering result in a single segment.

# If ``cAdd`` is set back to the default, the segment is correct.

s.cAdd = 0.5
