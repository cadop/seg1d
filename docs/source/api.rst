seg1d can be used through both the routines and through the ``Segmenter`` class,
which provides various methods for constructing a segmenter by setting parameters and data. 

This section contains the more advanced usage of the package by creating an instance
of the class. The usage is explained through different sample datasets, both of real
and generated data. Each example emphasizes a different aspect of the segmentation process.
