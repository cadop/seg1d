Community Guidelines

Issues
------

Issues and feature requests should be submitted on `github <https://github.com/cadop/segment1d/issues>`_ . 


Contributing
------------

Please follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow. 
However, it is suggested to create an issue first to confirm the contributions align with the future of the module.

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

Documentation is on the main branch of the repository (rather than gh-pages) and should be built as-is. 
A redirect ``index.html`` file handles moving the github pages to the build directory and a ``.nojekyll`` file 
preserves folder types.
