Simple Interface
================

This method is shown in the getting started section of the documentation. It provides an 
easy-to-use interface for segmenting data, although it has limited functionality in 
fine-tuning parameters of the underlying algorithms.

Class
=====

The Class reference should be used for any advanced usage or when needing 
convenience functions for adding data and tuning parameters of the segmentation process.

Methods
=======

The Methods reference explains the individual routines that are used in the segmentation process. 
Although they are accessible directly, it is likely easier to (and recommended) to use the Class.
